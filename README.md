# Welcome to My Numerical Methods Course Repository!

Hello! I'm excited to share with you the knowledge and techniques I've learned in my university numerical methods course. This repository covers a wide range of fundamental numerical methods, including:

- **Root-Finding Methods**: Fixed Point Iteration, Bisection Method, Newton-Raphson Method, and Secant Method.
- **Iterative Methods for Linear Systems**: Jacobi Method and Gauss-Seidel Method.
- **Numerical Differentiation and Integration**: Various techniques to approximate derivatives and integrals.
- **Solving Differential Equations**: Heun's Method, Euler's Method, and the Runge-Kutta Method.
- **Partial Differential Equations**: An introduction to hyperbolic and parabolic equations, specifically the wave and heat equations.

## Contents
- **Syllabus**: Overview of the course structure and topics covered.
- **Lecture Materials**: Notes, slides, and additional resources from the lectures.
- **Laboratory Works**: Practical assignments and projects to apply the concepts learned.

## Programming languages
The methods are implemented using Python and C++.

## Goal
The primary goal of this repository is to introduce you to these essential numerical methods, providing a solid foundation for further study and application in computational mathematics.
